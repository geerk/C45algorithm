This is an implementation of C4.5 algorithm
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm).

Data table has folowing format:
{
    "<column name>': [<column values>],
    "<column name>': [<column values>],
    ...
}


The main functions are located in file mine.py:
- "mine_c45" is an implementation of the C4.5 algorithm. To run the algorithm you need to pass a table in the format described above;
- "tree_to_rules" is a function for generate rules from desicion tree.
